1. Overview
------------
Alot of times when you crack Visual Basic programmes, you want to
disassemble them and search up positions by the String References, but
Visual Basic uses Wide Char format, so W32Dasm can't process those strings.
What can you do in order to view those strings? Use vbref :)


2. Disclaimer
--------------
I'm not responsible for anything ;)


3. What to do?
---------------
If you don't know how to use VBRef, you're probably won't be able to crack
the programme, since it's very simple.

                  ..(And I'm too lazy for writing help <g>)..


4. Technical notes
-------------------
Some time has passed because I saw duelist's better solution to VB strings.
I wanted to add wpj file format support, but when none of you lazy bastards
bothered to mail me about info, and as I am a lazy bastard too, it was
easier and more fun to write a GUI for VBRef, which now has features
similiar to W32Dasm. Well.. Have fun with it ;)

By the way, I coded it in C. I dislike languages like Delphi or Visual
Basic, they seem to be overbloated, slow, and sometimes inflexible. C
however is a very tight, fast and flexible language compared to other high
level languages.

6. The future of VBRef
-----------------------
    -   I don't know, you suggest?


7. History of VBRef
--------------------
1.0       - Initial release
1.1 (i)   - Documentation fix
          - Added line space in string ref, so it will look exactly like
            W32Dasm's generated file
          - Very brutal speed optimizing :)
          - Overwrite option
          - Bug fix: If string after String Reference is smaller than 9
            characters, the String Reference will appear again.
2.0       - GUI
          - W32Dasm alike features.
2.1       - Silly me.. Now VBRef will import Ordinal names correctly.
          - GUI: Added Status bar and Tool bar.
          - VBRef now restores its size and position.
new       - Speeded up disassembly reconstruction.
          - Better error handling.
          - Shows percentage for line indexing too..

(i) Means internal version.
